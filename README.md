## LibDriver HX711

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/hx711/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

HX711 is a 24 bit A / D converter chip specially designed for high precision electronic scales, which adopts the patented technology of Haixin technology integrated circuit. Compared with other chips of the same type, the chip set is more stable.It has the advantages of high integration, fast response and strong anti-interference. It reduces the electron density. The overall cost of the scale improves the performance and reliability of the whole machine.

LibDriver HX711 is a full function driver for HX711, launched by LibDiver.It provides differential reading and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver HX711 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver HX711 gpio platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver HX711driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver HX711 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver HX711 offline document.

/datasheet includes HX711 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface gpio platform independent template and finish your platform gpio driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_hx711_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
int32_t raw_voltage;
double voltage_v;

res = hx711_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    res = hx711_basic_read((int32_t *)&raw_voltage, (double *)&voltage_v);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)hx711_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    hx711_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    hx711_interface_debug_print("hx711: raw voltage is %d.\n", raw_voltage);
    hx711_interface_debug_print("hx711: voltage is %fmV.\n", voltage_v); 

    ...
    
}

...

(void)hx711_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
